# Description

In this semester, I will lead you guys together to learn the Quantum Optics
lectures teached by [Prof. Carlos Navarrete-Benlloch](https://www.carlosnb.com/) from Shanghai Jiao Tong
University.

We will use the the [Lecture Notes](https://www.carlosnb.com/quantum-optics-course) provided by Prof. Carlos as our textbook. And
I think I will try to make the cource self-consistent enough so that you don&rsquo;t
need to spend extra time reading materials before every class. But for a better
understanding of the cources, it may be worthwhile for you to spend extra time
to read materials or do some derivations after class.

If you find any question during the cources, you are encouranged to raise it in
the [Issues](https://github.com/Sollovin/Quantum-Optics-Learning-in-2021/issues) function accompanied with the repository so that others can join the
discussion easily and the discussion will also be recorded for future review.

Materials:

-   All the text materials provided by Prof. Carlos are put in the
    `/home/wangtao/ljt_group/Lectures on Quantum Optics - 2020/courseware` folder on
    our server.
-   On Youtube there are [videos cources](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQOPozM-bhZrWIyxwD_sMe9Q0HvwMzJNS) uploaded by Prof. Carlos. If you cannot
    connect to Youtube, you can find the video on our server in the
    `/home/wangtao/ljt_group/Lectures on Quantum Optics - 2020` folder.
-   The notes I write for the cource are put in the [notes](https://github.com/Sollovin/Quantum-Optics-Learning-in-2021/tree/master/notes) folder in the
    repository.
-   If any other materials are need, I will upload to here in time.

Finally, have fun with the cources and thanks to Prof. Carlos for the excellent
lectures.
